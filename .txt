Backend Development Update! 

 This week at the TEACH2GIVE Bootcamp, we dove into backend development, and it was an exciting ride!

We covered:

 ✅ Node.js

 ✅ Prisma

 ✅ Express.js

To wrap things up, we built a practical API together in class. To reinforce our understanding, we were also tasked with creating a simple CRUD API as part of our assignment. The API performs the following operations:

Create a task

Retrieve all tasks

Retrieve a specific task

Update a task

Delete a task

Sounds fun, right? It was!

 While it initially felt overwhelming, putting everything into practice made it all click—and it turned out to be simpler than I thought. Big thanks to my good friend Anthony for his support throughout the process!
